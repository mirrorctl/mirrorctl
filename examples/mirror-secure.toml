## TLS CONFIGURATION ##

# WARNING: Only set to true for testing - this disables certificate verification!
insecure_skip_verify = false

# Custom CA certificate file (optional)
# In short, the ca_cert_file is an escape hatch for environments where you are not connecting
# directly to a public server using a publicly trusted certificate. The certificate file itself is
# provided by the organization that is intercepting the traffic or hosting the private service.
# For any standard connection to a public website from a normal unproxied network, this option
# should remain commented out.
# ca_cert_file = "/etc/ssl/certs/custom-ca.pem"

# Client certificate for mutual TLS authentication (optional)
# You would only use this if the server administrator explicitly told you that mTLS is required
# and gave you the necessary files.
# client_cert_file = "/etc/ssl/certs/client.pem"
# client_key_file = "/etc/ssl/private/client.key"

# Specify allowed cipher suites for extra security (optional)
# Leave commented to use Go's secure defaults
# cipher_suites = [
#     "TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384",                   # TLS 1.3

#     "TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384",  # TLS 1.2
# ]


# Custom server name for SNI (optional)
# It tells the server which website's certificate you are requesting.
# In almost all normal situations the application will automatically set the SNI based on the
# mirror's URL. You can likely leave this commented out.
# server_name = "packages.micorosft.com"
